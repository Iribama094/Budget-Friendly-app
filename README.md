# Magic Patterns - Vite Template

This code was generated by [Magic Patterns](https://magicpatterns.com) for this design: [Source Design](https://www.magicpatterns.com/c/u4end8zetrf9ihkbhgmqqr)

## Getting Started

1. Run `npm install`

### Frontend-only

Run the Vite dev server:

1. `npm run dev`

Note: the app now calls the backend under `/v1/*`, so for a fully working experience you should use the “Full stack” option below.

### Full stack (recommended for testing)

This repo includes Vercel Serverless Functions under `api/` (MongoDB + JWT auth).

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in values.
2. Install the Vercel CLI (once): `npm i -g vercel`
3. Run: `vercel dev`

Then open the URL Vercel prints. The app will call `/v1/*` which is rewritten to `/api/v1/*`.

### Using a deployed backend

If your backend is hosted elsewhere, set `VITE_API_BASE_URL` (e.g. `https://your-deployment.vercel.app`) and run `npm run dev`.
